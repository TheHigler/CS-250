How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User Stories takes what the customer and end user want to accomplish and places them into bite size informational snippets showing what they want that particular implentation to do, how large of an implemntation it may be, as well as ways the topic should be implemented and tested. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Agile has may processes that I feel are important to project development. Organization and communication being the most important to me. Open communication  allows the team to be easily adaptable to any shift changes within a project while organization helps maintain this sort of flexibility. 

I will also utilize some of the various tools available like Jira and Azure which will help keep information visible and communication easy. I will also use estimation practices like afinity grouping to quickly dertermine how our backlog items should be grouped and indentified. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Some of the ways one can be a good team member would be having the ability to effectively give and receive feedback. Nobody is perfect and some of us are stronger in some areas than others. Being able to give and receive constructive feedback allows the team to grow in both knowledge and dynamic. Communication is equally imporant; being communicative allows the team to grow and work well together.
